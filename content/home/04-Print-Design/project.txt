##Christmas Cards
These are some cards that I made for Christmas 2010. It was just a personal project to learn more about Illustrator.

##Interface Element Posters
I lead a team to come up with design principles for AppNexus. To help publicise them at the company I created some posters. They were based on patterns made from interface elements. Since the actual principles themselves were only relevant internally at AppNexus I recreated a series with the interface element as the title.

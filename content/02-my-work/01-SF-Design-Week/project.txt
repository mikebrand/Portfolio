Title: SF Design Week

Text: 

I volunteer to help with the San Francisco Design Week website. I'm the lead for the news side. The first project I tackled was the article page. I had to work within the brand requirements while also making a great read experience.

##Content Structure##
Part of working on the website was creating a content structure. This involved auditing our social channel and their requirements so that we could make sharing content as easy as possible.

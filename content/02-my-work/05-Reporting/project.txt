Title: Student Reporting
----
Text: CK-12 is a not for profit that makes educational resources for high school students. The website had a "Groups" feature where teachers could share content with their students. My task was to create representations of the results of doing the practice, one for the teachers and one for the students. 

I started with an overview grid so that the teacher could orient themselves and see which students needed help. Initially my design called for a larger number of students to be shown on this page; however, the developers said that would not be possible. We settled on showing a subsection of students at a time. 

The student's view is a chronological listing of their most recently completed assignments. Based on interviews with students I broke the results down by concepts as opposed to subjects.  They saw the concept level of granularity as the best way to plan their studying.

Short: Reporting was designed to allow teaches and students to both get an overview of assignment practice results.

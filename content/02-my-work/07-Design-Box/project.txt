Title: Design Box
----
Text: Designbox is a tool for sharing in-progress designs. Its main focus is on supporting the designer in getting good quality feedback on his or her work. It also allows the user to keep a history of designs that shows them their progress and keep track of feedback over time. The plan is for Design Box to consists of three parts, an iPhone app for capturing paper designs, a Mac app that interfaces with the Creative Suite to capture digital designs, and a website for viewing images. 

I conducted initial research to learn about user's work flows and file set up. From there I coded a prototype mac app (in Objective-C) and built a functioning PHP back end.

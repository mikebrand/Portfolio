This was my first time trying <a href = "https://medium.com/@mikeybrand/remote-pair-designing-5f082e78e038">pair designing</a>. We started off by visiting some of our users and watching how they went about their morning process. We learned that the number one thing they care about is how they're tracking relative to their monthly goal.  

From there we started white boarding ideas, frequently checking in with the developers and product managers. We did some usability testing and iterated a few times.

The product was a huge success, one user said "This is the first time clicking a button in Console has been fun." Recently it's been used as a sales tool as well. 

This was also one of my first projects using <a href = "www.framerjs.com">Framer.js</a> to build prototypes. I did a <a href = "http://share.framerjs.com/pbh6hq138650/">quick exploration of a loading animation</a>.

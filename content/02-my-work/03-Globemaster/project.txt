Title: Globemaster
----
Text: The Globemaster table was created for a physical interaction subject. It's an interactive globe that displays information about countries. The user selects a location by moving the globe, once the user stops moving the ball the information fades in. People who came by at the exhibition were really engaged with it and would look up information for many different countries. We had quite a few people who enjoyed using it so much that they dragged their friends over.

This was a teamwork assignment. We started out with us brainstorming different ideas, and then we moved on to sketching and story boarding how people would use the globe and how it would work. From here we created some prototypes of different aspects - some fake visualisations, and some different tables.

I helped out with the initial idea conceptualisation and table design. From there I was responsible for designing and coding the information display. I used Action Script 3 to connect to the Flickr and Google Maps APIs.

For the design we had some specific constraints. We were using a projector in a location with variable ambient light levels, so the design had to very high contrast. The resolution was only 800px by 800px, which meant keeping everything minimalist.
